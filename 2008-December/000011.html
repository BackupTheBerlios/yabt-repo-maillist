 YABT is a general translation system written in the python programming language. It is primarily written for Braille 
-translation, but due to its general design, it might be possible to use it for other purposes such as preparing text for 
-input to a speech synthesiser, or even other uses not imagined by the author.

-===========================
-Basic usage example of YABT
-===========================
-
-Introduction
-============
-
-This documentation is to give some basic examples of how YABT can be used in applications to achieve Braille 
-translation. This is not a developer guide for extending YABT. With in this document it will be assumed that you have 
-already installed YABT and it works correctly.
-
-Importing YABT
-==============
-
-For any application using YABT you will need its loaders module and translators module.
-
-&gt;&gt;&gt; from YABT import loaders, translators
-
-To use the translation files provided with YABT you will need to include the pkg_resources module from setuptools. If 
-you are shipping your translation tables and have them on the file system then this step is not necessary, but we are 
-doing it here as these examples use the in built tables.
-
-&gt;&gt;&gt; import pkg_resources
-
-This is all you need for the basic use, so it is time to move on to loading the translation table.
-
-Loading a Translation Table
-===========================
-
-YABT 2.0 has separated its translator from the loader for the translation tables, so that potentially other formats of 
-translation table may be created and used. In these examples we will only use the basic XML format used in YABT 1.0.
-
-First we need to create the loader object. YABT ships with two loaders, one to read XML from a file, and one to read XML 
-from a string. For loading from files use BasicXMLFileLoader and from strings use BaiscXMLSTringLoader.
-
-&gt;&gt;&gt; fileLoader = loaders.BasicXMLFileLoader()
-&gt;&gt;&gt; stringLoader = loaders.BasicXMLStringLoader()
-
-For the file loader you should pass in a file like object into the setInput method.
-
-&gt;&gt;&gt; fileLoader.setInput(pkg_resources.resource_stream(&quot;YABT&quot;, &quot;tables/britishtobrl.xml&quot;))
-
-For the string loader pass a string object into the setInput method.
-
-&gt;&gt;&gt; stringLoader.setInput(pkg_resources.resource_string(&quot;YABT&quot;, &quot;tables/britishtobrl.xml&quot;))
-
-Now we need to create the translator objects which the loader should load into. Currently YABT comes with two translator 
-implementations Translator and BufferedTranslator. The Translator class will translate the entire of the string in one 
-go, where as the BufferedTranslator splits the string into lines before translating. This makes BufferedTranslator 
-faster than Translator, but BufferedTranslator is unable to apply any rule which has a focus which spans a new line 
-character, which is unlikely so generally BufferedTranslator is recommended.
-
-&gt;&gt;&gt; bufferedTranslator = translators.BufferedTranslator()
-&gt;&gt;&gt; translator = translators.Translator()
-
-Tell the translator objects to load the translation data from the loader objects by calling the load method on the 
-translator and passing in the loader object.
-
-&gt;&gt;&gt; translator.load(fileLoader)
-&gt;&gt;&gt; bufferedTranslator.load(stringLoader)
-
-Now we should be able to proceed in actually using the translators for Braille translation.
-
-Performing Translation
-======================
-
-You perform a translation by calling the translate method on the translator objects. This method takes the string (which 
-can be unicode) to translate, the translation state, a string to show what text should appear before and a string to 
-show what text should appear after. The state is used to represent different modes, in the britishtobrl table we are 
-using, state 1 is for grade1, 2 is for grade2 and 5 is for computer Braille. These states may potentially vary for other 
-tables, and additional states may exist. The context strings are not actually translated and do not appear in the 
-translation, they are purely to tell YABT what text is meant to surround the translation string so that the correct 
-rules can be used at the ends of the translation, so that should the output be joined with other Braille no join should 
-be noticeable.
-
-&gt;&gt;&gt; bufferedTranslator.translate(&quot;hello world&quot;, 2, &quot; &quot;, &quot; &quot;)
-u'HELLO _W'
